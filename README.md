# 2025-06_DigitalTwinsOfSmartCities

In the winter semester of 2024/25, I attended the research seminar ‘Digital Twins and their Use Cases’ at the University of Potsdam. Part of the module included presentations on various application options for digital twins. My presentation on ‘Digital Twins in Smart Cities’ and the corresponding report can be found here.
